Overview: 
A Python-based project that uses eye movements to control the volume on a laptop. It is designed to provide hands-free audio control, especially helpful for users with limited mobility or accessibility needs.

Features:
• Control laptop volume using only eye movements
• Detects eye landmarks in real-time
• Adjusts volume based on eye landmark distances (e.g. blink or eye opening/closing)
• Hands-free, camera-based interaction

Technologies Used:
• Python
• OpenCV – for video capture and image processing
• MediaPipe – for real-time eye landmark detection
• AudioUtilities and IAudioEndpointVolume – to interface with system audio controls on Windows

How It Works:
1. The webcam captures a live feed of your face.
2. MediaPipe detects and tracks key eye landmarks.
3. The distance between specific landmarks (here upper and lower eyes, and blink distance) is measured.
4. Based on blink distance:
    • If distance is higher than thresold, volume increases.
    • If distance is lower than thresold,  volume decreases.
5. The volume is adjusted in real time through the Windows audio interface.

Set Up: 
1. Clone or download this repository. (*Make sure all files — including the VolumeEyeControl.py and Module.py — are in the same folder.)
2. Install the required Python libraries: (pip install opencv-python mediapipe pycaw comtypes)
3. Connect your webcam.
4. The script uses your default webcam (usually cv2.VideoCapture(0)), but you may need to change the index (0, 1, etc.) depending on your system configuration.
5. Run the eye tracking script.
